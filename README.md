# Google::Wrapper

Small gem to wrap google-api-client

google-api-client can be a bit gnarly to work with sometimes. This makes things easier for us.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'google-wrapper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install google-wrapper
